2. Describe Coupling and Cohesion with examples.
-> Coupling is the mechanism where one object is dependent to another object.
-> This can be achieve by dependency injection.
-> This can be of loosely coupling and tightly coupling.
-> If one object can not exist with out other object the it is said to be tightly coupling
	whereas if two objects somehow not that much dependent to eachother then it is loosely coupling.
-> It is heighly recomendent to have loose coupling between classes and objects.
-> Loose coupling can be achieve through Inheritance which is a basic building block of OOPS.
-> Similary it is highly recommended to have high cohesion.
-> Example:
	If one have interface as Person and have class as Professor and Department.
	-> Person is implemented by Professor.
	-> Here Professor is professor with or without Department.
	-> This nature is loose coupling.
